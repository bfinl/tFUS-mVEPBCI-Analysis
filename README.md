These codes were used for the analysis of EEG BCI data as part of the study: J. Kosnoff, K. Yu, C. Liu, and B. He, “Transcranial Focused Ultrasound to V5 Enhances Human Visual Motion Brain-Computer Interface by Modulating Feature-Based Attention.” bioRxiv, p. 2023.09.04.556252, Sep. 5, 2023. doi: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556252.

In many cases, MNE Python based codes were copied, with some alteration, from MNE Python tutorials. I have done my best to mark all of the direct copied and pasted lines of code with their source.

Some comments in the code may refer to "tFUS" and "US-Control" conditions. These are in reference to our earliest naming of experimental conditions. The names were changed during the Peer Review process, and in most cases updated in the code. If you do come across "tFUS" and "US-Control," "tFUS" refers to "tFUS-GC" and "US-Control" to "tFUS-GP"
